### IPFS Peer Scanner

`peerscan` scans peers in an IPFS network for general diagnostic information which can be useful for security purposes. 
It was initially created as a degreeware: that is, software written in the pursuit of a university degree.

It's usage can be seen in this [lab](https://github.com/sne-ot-research/ipfs-lab-environment) which is a docker compose 
that defines a private IPFS network.
